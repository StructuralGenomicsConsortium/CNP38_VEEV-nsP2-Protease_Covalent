# CNP38_VEEV-nsP2-Protease_Covalent

An SGC Open Chemistry Networks Project devoted to the discovery and development of VEEV nsP2 Protease covalent inhibitors. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a mosquito-borne neurotropic virus. VEEV infections induce flu-like symptoms and can progress in severe cases to encephalitis and death. This project aims to develop novel compounds against VEEV nsP2 Protease as starting points for medicines for future coronavirus pandemics. In this work, a sulfamate-based chemical series has been identified as promising starting scaffolds against VEEV and as inhibitors of the cysteine protease domain of VEEVâ€™s nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2). Tunable cysteine reactivity, less reactivity towards GSH, and nanomolar VEEV potency are some of the key features of this series of VEEV-active analogs. The group is currently involved in hit-to-lead optimization by analysis of physchem properties, GSH reactivity, in vitro PK to develop a first-in-class VEEV nsP2 Protease covalent inhibitor.

You contribute synthetic chemistry and in return the SGC offers biology. Together we can generate tool compounds to understand biology and validate drug targets to help cure disease. Everything is open, with all content governed by a CC-BY-4.0 licence.

If you'd like to contact someone to talk about contributing, then write something in an Issue (see the tab above), which is a good way to communicate openly. (Issues describe what currently needs doing and act as a discussion forum - you need a Github account but it's super easy and not spammy. There's also an email address (chemistry@thesgc.org) you can use to ask questions. You can read more about all this in the "How To" Area
